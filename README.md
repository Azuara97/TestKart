# TestKart

## A simple Mario Kart's clone developed for a college test during my bachelor's studies.

The game is using a simple movement because, for the limited time, I prefered to have other mechanics finished.
It has mechanics as little checkpoints that if you touch them you add time to your time available, an object that can be a speed boost for you or a trap (choosing random when you touch it).
Also contains a simple skin selection pre-game.

Tha game save data in a file using binary encryption, saving data as:
+ Number of races finished.
+ Best time
+ Last Skin Selected.

## Instructions
+ Clone repository
+ Open project with Unity Engine
